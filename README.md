Project Ambition: BUILD for Social Good on web3 with Infura and Truffle and Polygon

Project Name: Supports for Social Good by making Contents.

Project Description:

The project is a content posting website (similar to medium, Wikipedia and etc.) but with an emphasis on social cause. Traditional web 2.0 rewards users by giving them money while at the same time cutting a large chunk of ad revenue just because they are the middle men. This project solves the issue by getting rid of the “centralized” middle men while doing good to the society. In addition, we are also trying to solve the problem where beginner authors are not getting immediate reward, hence making them lose motivation in the long run. We are offering them NFTs as soon as they post content. The reward increases if they continue to make impactful content in the future or gather more support from the community.

In this dApp, a person who contributes can earn tokens by:
1.	Upon making a valid content/post she or he is awarded an NFT on the wallet address.
2.	The ad revenue generated is directly sent to her/his wallet.
3.	Any third-party sponsors/users/readers/community members can donate tokens to support the cause.

The user can make posts on topics from current social issues to ideas that improve quality of life for people, pretty much anything that can help increase social goods in general.

Target Audience: NGOs, organizations and individuals who are looking for contents/posters for their campaign on social causes. It can be also used by any person wanting to learn about and/or support social problems and their solutions.
